Mononoke captures your eyes with its unique textured backdrop that has an uncanny resemblance to crumpled washi paper. This technique of using one texture for everything executed in something other than a photograph or a drawing could be called lazy or visually brassy yet Mononoke accomplishes this with elegance and aesthetically pleasing surrealism. Every scene in Mononoke looks like it could be taken out of your screen and plastered on a wall... See full review -> 0.751654\n",

The only problem with the show is that all of the characters are so dumb it actually gives you a headache. The murderer could literally kill a character in front of all of the other ones, and still no one would do anything. The characters are like NPCs that just walk around waiting to be killed, and whenever the detective of the story gets too close to figuring it out, the authors come up with some reason for him to forget all of the stuff that happened each episode so that he is reset for the next murder...

      "I genuinely consider Domestic Girlfriend to be good anime. Although the anime can be fairly predictable at some times, there is to a certain extent character development. There were some movements in the animation that quite bothered me, especially when Natsuo would go to kiss Hina or Rin since the movements were not natural. The voice actors made an incredible role to interpret the personality of the character from the manga, plus the background music would genuinely be good for the type of situation/circumstance, and let's not forget about the insane song in the opening.

Although I thought it was a little weird that Kouhei was cooking with his student, the dynamic ended up having more of a family feel. Life isn’t cut and dry, and I feel like this anime showcased that well with the challenged Tsugumi and her dad faced together. I enjoyed learning about Japanese cuisine and by the end of the series, I found myself making the okonomiyaki along with them! A quick, relaxing, and wholesome... See full review -> 0.884473\n",
      "No spoilers- The movie was enjoyable but nothing special. I enjoyed the period setting and its subsequent visuals and accompanying music, but the story was really lacking for me. I thought it would go more in-depth into her growth as her own artist, but instead her and her father performed spiritual services? I enjoyed the whimsical aspect of it, but felt it was extremely disjointed from the other story points. In addition, there was an attempt at creating a romance, of which was never flushed out as well. A lot of good ideas but none of them were well executed. I think this movie would have benefitted from... See full review -> 0.772296\n",
      "The story is about a wired school, where you need to make one of your underclassmen your sister. This is about love, jealous ,a little bit wierd.\n",
      "Though the story is not that much good but I can't Stop myself from watching it. I don't even want to know the ending but still I don't know why I am watching more and more episodes \n",
      "So it is not that much good and not boring at all \n",
      "So you can give it a. Try  -> 0.743756\n",
      "i love this but its trash its very short so give it ago if you are thinking about it there is literally no story line but the illustrations are cute <3 THE CAT IS TOO CUTE <3  -> 0.563560\n",
      "3 S review No.5 (short, simple and salty/sweet/spicy)\n",
      "Ok, lot of people are saying don’t read anything about the show, just watch it, you gonna spoil it etc. Bunch of crap, nothing here to get spoiled. The so called plot twist is revealed really early in the show. Its not really a plot twist, its just the way the world in this show is. And I gotta tell you, its pretty intriguing and gloomy. The thing is though, there is a big contradiction here, between what is presented, and how it is presented. As dark and gloomy the world really is, the presentation is quite light hearted and kind of... See full review -> 0.809859\n",
      "I liked it a lot, especially since it explored some dark and mature themes. Ultimately, I wish I got a better insight into Sato's past and friends, but I loved it. I wish there were more episodes. -> 0.577263\n",
      "This was an okay show. The animation was good and the story was kind of okay. The music was just sort of okay, and while the characters are entertaining and visually interesting on a base level, very few of them are really expanded upon beyond their um... unique interests. The show is an acceptable time killer for sure, but don't go in with the highest of expectations. Watch if you can't think of anything else to watch or do. Basic harem stuff. -> 0.770844\n",
      "Ah. This movie stings in all the right ways. It is an effective period piece, and the attention to detail in the environments is incredible. The world building sets the stage beautifully with its appealing art and sometimes disturbing imagery, and that stage is set for two very well executed main characters. This film is a beautiful tragedy. I highly urge folks to watch this one. -> 0.617097\n",
      "This is an interesting anime. It may not be your anime, but it has some interesting things to say about the anime industry itself. It propogates the elements of the enime industry that kinda get creators, from the writers to the actors, to end up stuck in a place where they are producing the mediocre. So I give its story some points for that. The animation is good. The music is fine, I guess. The characters are also, fine, I guess. -> 0.811238\n",
      "It is far from my favorite Ghibli film, but like most of the other Ghibli movies, this film excelently combines story, animation, and music into an immersive and joy filled cinematic experience. The characters travel through an enticing narrative. I highly recomend the film to folks that seek out immersive and beautiful film experiences. -> 0.653580\n",
      "Okay. I am going to approach this review with as little bias as possible. If I am going to be honest, as an Eva fan, I don't like this movie that much. It hurts my weeb feelings, but as a lover of film, this thing still has some merit. As many others have pointed out, this film suffers from lacking certain artistic elements of the original series, but I am going to ignore that and approach this from the perspective that the creator asked me to, to see it as a \"companion piece\". I will not so much compare it to the original as I will try to look at it as an independent film meant to be consumed... See full review -> 0.764706\n",
      "Perfect Blue is an iconic psychological horror movie. It blurs the line of reality and imagination using the addiction and darkside to the world of fame. The animation is rich and eery, creating a noir sense which heightens the quality. The movie is somewhat explicit. The action is wrapped up with a somewhat ludicrous revelation, which, on its own terms, doesn't exactly make sense, but Perfect Blue has its own kind of cult pungency. Satoshi Kon works will always be held in high regard and this is a perfect example of that. In the film Requiem For A Dream, the latter director acquired the rights only to...
