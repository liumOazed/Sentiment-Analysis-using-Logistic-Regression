# Sentiment-Analysis-using-Logistic-Regression

In this project, I used python and beautifulsoup4 to scrap anime data from "Anime Planet" (https://www.anime-planet.com/anime/naruto-shippuden/reviews) website. 
I scraped 52 pages of this website to scrap the anime names, user_names, Anime Reviews and Rating and then saved it in a csv file using pandas dataframe. I have scraped 2600 anime reviews and corresponding ratings from "Anime Planet" website and then build a logistic regression algorithm to predict the sentiment and checked the accuracy.
